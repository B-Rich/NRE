This is the NOVA runtime environment (NRE). To get started, please take the following steps:

1. Go into the directory cross/.
2. Execute the download.sh. It will download binutils, gcc and newlib into the current directory.
3. Execute build.sh <arch>, where <arch> is either x86_32 or x86_64. This builds the cross compiler.
   Thus, it will take a few minutes :)
4. Before you continue, choose the target and build-type that you want to use:
   export NRE_TARGET=(x86_32|x86_64) NRE_BUILD=(debug|release)
5. Go into the directory nre. You'll find the convenience-script b, which is responsible for building
   everything that needs to be build and executing the specified command. So, simply do a "./b"
   (it might be convenient to put "." into $PATH, if not already done) to build everything. It will
   checkout and build NOVA, checkout and build the chainloader and - of course - build NRE as well.
   Please take a look at the very end of b to see the commands that are supported. For a quick start,
   use "b run test" to run the test application in qemu.
6. To use "b srv <script>", you have to generate the novaboot-config by:
   ./tools/novaboot --dump-config > ~/.novaboot
   You might want to adjust it afterwards
